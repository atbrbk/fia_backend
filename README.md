# fia_backend
#### Backend server created with python based web framework Flask. It's very minimalistic, and we can fast write clean code with it. In product must be used Django for better perfermance for our platform.
#### Used database - MySql, hosted on free service db4free.net. Maybe some net lags, due to server performance.
#### For connecttion to database we used 'mysql-connector-python' library, which very comfortable for write simple queries.
