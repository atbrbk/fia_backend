# fia_backend
Backend server created with web framework Flask. It's very minimalistic, and we can write clean code with it.
Used database - MySql, hosted on free service db4free.net. Maybe some net lags, due to server performance.
To connect to database we used 'mysql-connector-python' library, which very comfortable for write projects.
